								<h2 class="major">Know who I am</h2>
								<p >Hello, I am Joyce Vieira. I grew up in Brazil and am a Computer Science & Mathematics student at Hunter College. My technology journey started in high school, where I focused on IT, but my curiosity led me to explore the creative side of technology through Animation and Character Design. This passion for the arts guided me to pursue a Fine Arts degree at Florence Academy Of Arts, where I deepened my understanding of traditional arts through visual storytelling and design. However, my fascination with technology never faded, ultimately bringing me back to Computer Science, where I now strive to merge both technical and creative perspectives in my work.</p>
								<p >I am a problem solver by nature, and my passion lies in leaving a positive footprint wherever I go. Whether it's through developing a software that will simplify processes, or creating intuitive digital solutions, I aim to bring value to those I collaborate with.</p>
								<p >My experiences include automating workflows and improving operational efficiency, streamlining project management tasks, and contributing to data-driven projects aimed at environmental preservation and healthcare accessibility. These experiences have allowed me to apply my technical and analytical skills in real-world situations, making a tangible impact.</p>
								<p >As I prepare for graduation in December 2025, I am eager to gain hands-on experience in solving complex problems through scalable software solutions, optimizing systems through data-driven insights, and developing intelligent models that enhance decision-making. I am looking for a company that fosters a diverse and collaborative environment—one that is intellectually stimulating and fuels my passion for making a difference in the world. I want to work with people who are open to sharing their knowledge, who approach challenges with curiosity, and who lead with kindness. Above all, I hope to contribute to a mission-driven organization that is committed to positively impacting people's lives through innovation and technology.</p>

															<p>This project demonstrates practical applications of emerging technologies in education, showcasing how VR and AI can be combined to create more effective learning tools.</p>

															<p>
																MathQuest VR is an immersive educational game designed for children ages 6-10, combining virtual reality technology with mathematical learning in an engaging fantasy forest environment.
															</p>
															<button class="read-more">Read More...</button>
															<div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
																<p class="indent">
																	As a math minor, I created MathQuest VR to solve a critical challenge in education: the anxiety young children feel when facing abstract math concepts. By leveraging Unity3D and the XR Interaction Toolkit, I developed an immersive Meta Quest 2 experience that transforms numbers into tangible 3D objects children can physically manipulate using intuitive hand tracking and gesture recognition.
																</p>
																<p class="indent">The technical execution features AI-powered adaptive learning at its core. I integrated OpenAI's API to create intelligent avatar companions that provide personalized hints and emotional support, while machine learning algorithms dynamically adjust problem difficulty based on each child's progress. This creates a stress-free environment where spatial puzzles replace traditional worksheets, giving immediate visual feedback as learners interact with mathematical concepts in three-dimensional space.</p>
																<p class="indent">From an architectural perspective, I engineered a modular system with four key components: an interactive framework for real-time 3D object manipulation, an intelligent assessment engine that generates dynamic problems, AI companions with natural language processing, and scalable fantasy environments that grow with the learner. Performance optimization was crucial, I maintained consistent 90fps rendering through efficient memory management and rigorous testing across both physical devices and Meta's XR Simulator.</p>
																<p class="indent">Leading a multidisciplinary team through agile development cycles, I established Git/GitHub workflows and continuous integration pipelines that ensured seamless collaboration. The result bridges cutting-edge technology with measurable educational impact: turning math avoidance into engaged exploration through emotionally intelligent design and evidence-based learning principles.</p>

																	<h3>Grocery Shopping Optimizer:<i> Intelligent Meal Planning System</i>
																	</h3>
															<p>
																I directed the creation of a sophisticated grocery planning system that tackles two critical household challenges: the $1,500 annual food waste burden per family and the difficulty of maintaining balanced nutrition. </p>
																<p>My solution transforms chaotic meal planning into an optimized science by modeling ingredient expiration timelines, nutritional requirements, and budget constraints within a unified algorithmic framework.
															</p>
															<button class="read-more">Read More...</button>
															<div class="expanded-content" style="display: none;">
																<p class="indent">
																	The core innovation lies in multi-dimensional dynamic programming that simultaneously optimizes across four critical axes: temporal ingredient freshness (tracking shelf life day-by-day), nutritional targets (protein, carbs, micronutrients), budget limitations, and user preferences. We pioneered state compression techniques to manage exponential complexity, incorporating waste-prediction heuristics that learn from usage patterns. The algorithm intelligently balances perishable versus non-perishable goods while ensuring recipe combinations share ingredients efficiently across meals.
																</p>
																<p class="indent">I architected a comprehensive full-stack solution featuring a high-performance C++ optimization engine with memoization and state hashing techniques. The system integrates a smart pantry tracker that monitors ingredient shelf life, coupled with a nutritional calculator analyzing 20+ micronutrients per recipe. The responsive web interface features an interactive meal calendar with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time waste/cost projections, and visual nutrition dashboards that simplify complex data into actionable insights.</p>
																<p class="indent">From an architectural perspective, I engineered a modular system with four key components: an interactive framework for real-time 3D object manipulation, an intelligent assessment engine that generates dynamic problems, AI companions with natural language processing, and scalable fantasy environments that grow with the learner. Performance optimization was crucial, I maintained consistent 90fps rendering through efficient memory management and rigorous testing across both physical devices and Meta's XR Simulator.</p>
																<p class="indent">Traditional meal planning fails because ingredients expire before use, nutritional balance is difficult to maintain, and last-minute changes disrupt shopping. My system introduces expiration-aware purchasing that prioritizes ingredients with complementary shelf lives, detects recipe synergies to maximize perishable usage, and enables adaptive replanning when schedules change. During testing with real families, the solution reduced grocery bills by 17-23% while ensuring 90%+ compliance with nutritional targets.</p>
